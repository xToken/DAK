# DAK Admin Kit
This collection of plugins (and loader) make up what I started calling DAK.

## Installation
* This mod can be downloaded via the Steam Workshop, and will autodownload on all clients on connect.
* The ModID for DAK is __5f4f178__, which you will want to set in the server command line, and in _MapCycle.json_.  The server will automatically download the mod once set.

For example,
* `-mods "5f4f178"` on your command line and
* `"mods": [ "5f4f178" ]` in _MapCycle.json_

### Bypassing Mod Filter
__NOTE__ - If you decide to load this from _Server.lua_ to bypass mod filter, you will __not__ want to add the ModID to the command line or _MapCycle.json_.

* Download the DAK Admin Kit files by either of the following ways
 * __From the Steam Workshop__
   Subscribe to DAK Admin Kit mod launch your game
   It will then create a folder in `%APPDATA%\Natural Selection 2\Workshop` called `m5f4f178_##################`
 * __From GitHub__
   Download the files and place them in your ```-modstorage``` location (default `%APPDATA%\Natural Selection 2\Workshop`)
* Once downloaded, you would want to merge them with your _ns2/lua_ folder (there will not be any files overridden)
* From there, you will want to edit _Server.lua_
* On line 9, add the line `Script.Load("lua/base/server.lua"), it should be before the line decoda_name = "Server"`

## Configuration
### DAKConfig.json
Once you launch the server with DAK installed, a _DAKConfig.json_ file will be automatically created in the `-config_path` from the server command line, or in `%APPDATA%\Natural Selection 2` if not specified.
All mods can be enabled/disabled and configured via the _DAKconfig.json_ file.  A sample usable config file is generated by the mod, which uses the recommended values.
To enable/disable 'plugins' that use this loader, you simple want to look for the `PluginsList` option in the _DAKConfig.json_ file, and add/remove the exact name of the plugin there.
You can see a list of all the available plugins in the plugin folder, there is a config_ and plugin_ for each one.

Below is a sample of the default plugins and their config options, with an explanation of each option.

```
 {
 	{ "name": "dragon", "id": 5176141, "reason": "meh", "time": 0 }

All server admin commands will also print to any other admin's consoles when used (admins that also have access to that command).
 
## Client Commands
These commands can be executed via chat or via the console (~)
* __timeleft__ - displays time left till next map vote.
* __acceptmotd__ - supresses motd messages unless the `kMOTDMessageRevision` is changed.
	* This is saved in _DAKSettings.json_ and persists between map changes.
* __printmotd__ - will print the motd out.
* __voterandom__ - will vote to enable random teams.
* __ready__ - marks your team as ready if tournamentmode is enabled.
* __vote__ - used to vote for a map during map vote, needs to have a number as a paramater.
* __rtv__ or __rockthevote__ - used to vote for a map vote (can be started anytime)
* __surrender__ - used to start or vote in an active surrender vote.
* __\lang__ - used to set your language.
 
## Languages
DAK also now includes a language system, which allows clients to specifiy their language to change the format/language of the messages they recieve.
* DAK will automatically generate a Default.json file in the lang folder in the config_path for the server.
* The Default.json file should be used to create any custom languages.  The language name is determined by the file name.
* If you are creating a new language, you will want to copy and rename _Default.json_ accordingly.
* This will allow those messages to still show up in game, before other language files are updated.
* You can configure the languages DAK will load in _DAKConfig.json_, EN being the only one by default.
* Clients can then change their language by using the two letter identification string for that language (currently using 2, EN, FR, ES etc.., may switch to 4 - ENUS, ENGB etc.)
* Currently they can use the console command `setlanguage en`, or use the chat command `\lang en`.
* As for configuring the messages, it works mostly the same as before, however all messages are located in the language json files, and you would need to customize each language as needed.
* The same notes still apply regarding regex strings, you will want to maintain the same amounts (%s, %f, %d). 
 
## Breakdown of current 'Plugins' system and the standard 'Plugins'
DAK extends various events from the engine, and creates a couple of its own.
 
```
 OnClientConnect
 OnClientDisconnect
 OnServerUpdate
 OnServerUpdateEveryFrame
 OnClientDelayedConnect
 OnTeamJoin
 OnGameEnd
 OnEntityKilled
 OnUpdatePregame
 OnCastVoteByPlayer
 OnSetGameState
 OnClientChatMessage
 CheckMapChange
 OverrideMapChange
 OnPluginInitialized
 OnPluginUnloaded
 OnConfigReloaded
```

Functions can be added to these variables which will be run when these events occur, sample shown below:
 
`DAK:RegisterEventHook(OnServerUpdate, UpdateMapVotes, 5) - (EventArray, Function, Priority)`
* This also allows a priority to be set for the Event, the higher the number the greater the priority.
* _Default: 5_
* This also allows for the EventHooks to be removed during runtime, for greater efficiency.
 
`DAK:DeregisterEventHook(OnServerUpdate, UpdateMapVotes) - (EventArray, Function)`
* This removes the function from the array, so that it wont be called anymore.
 
Plugins are loaded from the plugin folder by DAK, with config_ files being loaded to setup config/language strings if needed, and plugin_ files containing the plugin logic.
The config_ files uses an array to track all config functions:

`DAK"RegisterEventHook("PluginDefaultConfigs", {PluginName = "AFKKicker", DefaultConfig = SetupDefaultConfig })`
`DAK"RegisterEventHook("PluginDefaultLanguageDefinitions", SetupDefaultLanguageStrings)`
 
Notes about Gamerules overrides - they require the same args from vanilla NS2, or will need manual configuration.
This can be changed in _Loader.lua_, `GamerulesClassName` is the class name used when setting up the overrides.
Below are the functions overridden and their default configuration.
 
```
	function NS2Gamerules:JoinTeam(player, newTeamNumber, force)
	function NS2Gamerules:EndGame(winningTeam)
	function NS2Gamerules:OnEntityKilled(targetEntity, attacker, doer, point, direction)
	function NS2Gamerules:UpdatePregame(timePassed)
	function NS2Gamerules:SetGameState(state)
	function NS2Gamerules:CastVoteByPlayer(voteTechId, player)
	
	Also included is a function to capture chat messages and raise events based on them, disabling the gamerules extensions
	will also disable this.

	function Server.AddChatToHistory(message, playerName, steamId, teamNumber, teamOnly)
	
	Also have added some additional overrides for added logging:
	
	function CommandStructure:LoginPlayer(player)
	function CommandStructure:Logout()
	
	function RecycleMixin:OnResearchComplete(researchId)
	function RecycleMixin:OnResearch(researchId)
	
	function ConstructMixin:OnInitialized()
```

 These can be disabled in _DAKConfig.json_, GamerulesExtensions which is under Loader.
 
 Please note that errors caused in functions added are systemic, meaning they will affect the execution of NS2 gamecode, so some care must be taken.

## Plugins Description
 
__OverrideInterp Plugin__
* This is mainly for testing, however it overrides the default interpolation value of 100ms on each clients connect, making sure that the value is correct set client/server side.

__AFKKicker Plugin__
* This plugin checks if a player is idle by caching their viewangles and origin, and displays messages to alert them if they are going to be kicked.
* May in the future be improved to use idle parameter on the player.
 
__AutoConcede Plugin__
* This plugin adds an Automatic Concede check to the GameEnd function, which will alert players if the teams are different by a configurable amount of players
* and will end the game if the team imbalance isn't resolved after a configurable amount of time.
 
__AutoMapCycle Plugin__
* This plugin will automatically cycle the map after a configurable amount of time, and with a configurable minimum player count.
* It will invoke a MapCycle change, or alternatively can be configured to use a specific map list.

__Badges Plugin__
* This plugin is designed to extend Huze's badges mod slightly to allow for admins queried from the web via DAK to be recognized and the badges shown.
 
__BaseAdminCommands Plugin__
* This plugin replaces the basic admin commands that are provided with NS2, and changes some functionality.
* Also extends some basic functionallity, like offering GameIds for connected players.
 
__CommBans Plugin__
* This plugin allows commander bans to be set, which can be permanent or time based.
* They can be added and or removed in game.
* This allows adds protection to commander ejecting for various admin levels, if the sv_ejectionprotection command is granted.
 
__EnhancedLogging Plugin__
* This plugin enables alot of extra logging, which is done to a seperate directory within the configured server admin path.
* Sample log file below with some information omitted:

```

```

__GUIMenuBase Plugin__
* This plugin is designed to offer a basic client/server side GUI implementation.  Currently the plugin should be fully functional, however it requires the mod to be installed on the server via workshop.
* Since network messages are used to add the menu functionality, if a client did not have the mod they would be unable to connect.  This also needs a GUI for the menu to work correctly, which is the only part missing.
* A sample developed GUI is included in the GUI folder, however it is not complete and does not function currently.

__MapVote Plugin__
* This plugin provides a map voting system, which will read the mapcycle.txt for cycle time and the list of maps.
* On round end a map vote is triggered if enough time has elapsed, with a randomly selected list of maps which excludes some of the map last played.
* Since NS2 only has 5 offical maps currently, the plugin will automatically add back in maps if there is not enough to make the minimum.
* Almost all parts are configurable in the configs.

__Messages Plugin__
* This plugin provides a periodic message delivery function, which allows for flexible configuration:
* The total amount of messages, messages per block, interval between blocks, interval between message cycles, and a start delay for message cycling.

__MOTD Plugin__
* This plugin provides a MOTD system that could be more accurately described as a rules system, which allows clients to accept and have the messages not always appear on connect.  Should be loaded as last plugin so that other plugins can stop the messages if needed.
* Messages are also sent in groups so that they can all be viewed onscreen.

__Pause Plugin__
* This plugin is designed to add the ability to pause the game via various overrides and variable tweaking.  It is currently in developement and may not function accurately yet.

__ReservedSlots Plugin__
* Basic Reserve slots plugin, however is more a proof of concept and does not have the ability to work in a way that provides a good user experience.
* Basic framework may prove useful should the ability arise to reject clients connection earlier or modify query response.

__TournamentMode Plugin__
* Made a recent re-visit to this plugin to improve basics regarding it, created basic framework for PCW/Official modes.
* May continue to improve and add to differences between modes.
 
__UnStuck Plugin__
* This plugin provides an unstuck command for players, and has some basic configurable options for delays to prevent abuse, and to change the unstuck amount.
 
__VoteRandom Plugin__
* This plugin enables players to vote to enable random teams.
* Supports either randoming the teams instantly, or enabling random teams for a set duration, where the next game and all games for a set duration have random teams.

__VoteSurrender Plugin__
* This plugin provides a surrender vote system for each team, which can be used to vote for the game to end if a set percentage of the team votes.
